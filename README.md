# Java Learning

This is a repo with small projects I'm building as I learn Java.

## Plinko

The `PlinkoGame.java` file contains a simulation in which 10,000 coins are dropped from the middle slot of a Plinko board. The probability of the coin landing in each slot is known. We can then compare the results of our simulation to the expected values to see how well they match up.

To compile the code, enter `javac PlinkoGame.java` in your terminal.

To run the compiled code, enter `java PlinkoGame` in your terminal after compiling.

To run the JUnit tests, use the [VSCode Test Runner for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-test) extension.
